                    <b>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam</b>
                    was born on 15 October 1931, to a Tamil Muslim
                    family in the pilgrimage centre of Rameswaram on
                    Pamban Island, then in the Madras Presidency and
                    now in the State of Tamil Nadu. His father Jainulabdeen
                    Marakayar was a boat owner and imam of a local mosque;[9]
                    his mother Ashiamma was a housewife.[10][11][12][13] His
                    father owned a ferry that took Hindu pilgrims back and forth between Rameswaram and the now
                    uninhabited Dhanushkodi.[14][15] Kalam was the youngest of four brothers and one sister in his
                    family.[16][17][18] His ancestors had been wealthy Marakayar traders and landowners, with numerous
                    properties and large tracts of land. Marakayar are a Muslim ethnic group found in coastal Tamil Nadu
                    and Sri Lanka who claim descent from Arab traders and local women. The family business had involved
                    trading groceries between the mainland and the island and to and from Sri Lanka, as well as ferrying
                    pilgrims between the mainland and Pamban
